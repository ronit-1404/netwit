3. Run `supabase/migrations/20240102_interactions_table.sql` for SMS logging

### Vercel Deployment
1. Connect GitHub repository
2. Add environment variables
3. Configure cron job for `/api/cron/cleanup-leads`
4. Deploy

## Known Issues & Notes

1. **AI Chat Temporarily Disabled**
   - Tool API needs update for current `ai` package version
   - Feature can be re-enabled after fixing tool definition
   - No impact on core functionality

   - Backend implementation can be added incrementally
   - No broken links or errors
