## Tools Used

**GitHub Copilot** - Code completion suggestions in VSCode  
**Cursor AI** - Alternative editor with AI chat feature

---

## Development Workflow

### My Manual Work (Primary Development):
- Designed system architecture and database schema
- Wrote all financial calculation logic and provincial tax engine
- Implemented authentication system and security measures
- Created component structure and routing
- Wrote form validation schemas (Zod)
- Designed and implemented UI/UX patterns
- Manual testing and quality assurance
- Database query optimization strategy
- Performance monitoring and tuning

### AI Assistant Usage (Supporting Role):
- Code autocomplete for repetitive patterns
- Syntax suggestions for TypeScript types
- Quick reference for Tailwind CSS classes
- Regex pattern generation
- Documentation string formatting
- File search and navigation help

## Specific Examples

**Financial Calculations** - 100% manually written and verified  
- Researched Canadian tax rates for all 13 provinces
- Designed profit calculation formula  
- Implemented financing amortization
- Verified with test cases

**Database Optimization** - Manual analysis and implementation  
- Analyzed slow query logs
- Designed index strategy
- Created materialized views
- Wrote SQL migration files

**UI/UX Redesign** - Manual design and coding  
- Tested mobile responsiveness across devices
- Removed performance-impacting animations
- Implemented accessibility features
- Created consistent design patterns

**Bug Fixes** - Manual debugging  
- Identified hydration errors through testing
- Fixed nested form issues
- Resolved SSR/CSR mismatches
- Tested all fixes in browser

## Code Quality

- All logic and architecture: **Manually designed**
- Type safety: **Manually configured (TypeScript strict)**
- Testing: **Manually written (Playwright E2E)**
- Code review: **Personal review of all changes**

---

## Time Distribution

**Development Time:** ~27 hours total
- Manual coding & architecture: ~20 hours (74%)
- Code completion assistance: ~5 hours (18%)
- Debugging & testing: ~2 hours (8%)

**Key Takeaway:** AI tools provided productivity boost for repetitive tasks, while all critical business logic, architecture decisions, and quality assurance were done manually.
