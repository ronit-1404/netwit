-- ============================================================================
-- NOTES
-- ============================================================================
-- 1. These policies assume Supabase Auth is properly configured
-- 2. Test all policies with different user roles before production
-- 3. Consider adding audit logging for sensitive operations
-- 4. Review and adjust policies based on your specific business requirements
-- 5. The auth.uid() function returns the current authenticated user's ID
